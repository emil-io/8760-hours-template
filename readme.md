This repo contains a couple [markdown] templates based on the "A snapshot of
you" section of Alex Vermeer's [8,760 hours]. Specifically, version 2 of [the
pdf].

These templates are not a replacement for the guide, and it's intended that you
read the guide in order to give more context to this process. I'm publishing
this template for others that want to follow this guide by .  Note that it is
not necessary to answer every question, these are just to get you thinking.

Included templates:

* </snapshot.md> - a template for the section titled "A snapshot of you". The
  intention of answering these questions is to reflect on your past and present
  state.

* </vision-and-goals.md> - a template for the section titled "The next 8,760
  hours".

- </implementation.md> - a template for the section titled "Optimizing for
  success". This does not cover the yearly calendar or prioritizing portions.

I've included a script that can be run to create copies of the templates with
today's date prefixed:

```
$ ./instantiate.sh
```

# Differences with the guide

There is certainly a degree of discretion here on what to include and how to
organize it. Generally, it is organized in the order that the guide describes to
think about things. This may not be the best order for a document that you might
want to revisit later, so I encourage creating a third, more freeform document
summarizing your conclusions.

I changed the phrasing a bit on a few questions, but otherwise kept it pretty
much verbatim. My goal here is not to inject my own opinions on how to reflect
and steer one's life.

One of the main differences in <./snapshot-template.md> "is that I've combined
together the "initial overview" with the "detailed overview", and left out some
questions in these sections that I found a bit redundant.
